HTML,CSS,JS Screensavers

Originally, each screensaver each had a seperate domain, however, that got fairly hard to keep track of. This repository is for screensavers I have already made and will make in the future.

If you need more information, please read the rickin repository README.

have fun wasting hours of your life looking at random spinning images i found on the internet
